1) Positioning System
Positioning statement (core)

I help brands build digital commerce that actually scales across Southeast Asia.

One-line bio (for intros / LinkedIn / speaker pages)

Strategist-operator helping brands turn digital commerce into a durable growth pillar across SEA.

What you’re known for (the “sticky idea”)

Resilient digital commerce systems: launched, scaled, owned P&L, and built capabilities across multi-market complexity.

Who you serve (primary)

Regional ecommerce / digital commerce leaders (FMCG, consumer brands)

GMs / Commercial Directors / Marketing leads who own growth

Teams scaling across SG/MY/PH/VN/ID/TH with execution fragmentation

Your differentiation (clear + believable)

Most consultants are:

channel-specialists or deck-builders

You are:

P&L-fluent + launch-proven + systems-and-capability builder across SEA

“Anti-positioning” (what you’re NOT)

Not a growth-hacker

Not a dropshipping coach

Not a “10-step TikTok ads” person

Not a generic agency pitch

Proof pillars (use these repeatedly)

SEA multi-market complexity

Launch + scale speed (6 months across MY/PH/VN)

Commercial accountability (channel P&L)

Funnel capability (social commerce, affiliates, content selling)

Ecosystem leadership (MCNs, TSPs, agencies, category managers)

2) Brand Archetype
Primary: Strategist-Operator

Keywords: calm, commercial, structured, practical, decisive

Secondary: Calm Challenger

Keywords: sharp reframes, myth-busting, “here’s what actually works”

Brand behavior

You don’t overpromise

You simplify complexity

You talk tradeoffs and execution reality

3) Brand Voice & Copy Rules
Tone attributes

Calm confidence

Commercial clarity

Slightly opinionated

Low-buzzword, high signal

Copy rules (DO)

Lead with outcomes: “build durable growth pillars”, “reduce fragility”, “scale across SEA”

Use short sentences. Strong verbs.

Use “I help / I work with / I build” — not “we provide”

Copy rules (DON’T)

Don’t list tools, platforms, acronyms as proof

Don’t say “end-to-end”

Don’t say “data-driven” (assumed)

Don’t say “10 years experience” (show it instead)

Your signature phrases (consistent brand language)

“durable growth pillar”

“systems that last”

“commercial accountability”

“SEA complexity”

“capability, not dependency”

HOW I HELP (3 PILLARS)

1) Scale across SEA complexity
Southeast Asia isn’t one market. I help you build a strategy that respects local realities without losing regional coherence.

2) Conversion systems that stick
Funnels across social commerce, affiliates, content selling—designed so your team can run them consistently.

3) Performance with accountability
Media optimization tied to commercial outcomes—because dashboards don’t pay salaries.

SELECTED WORK (story cards)

Channel launches that became growth pillars
Launched digital commerce channels across Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam in under six months—built to continue delivering after launch.

Owning performance at scale
Led channel performance and execution across six SEA markets with a focus on profitable growth, not vanity metrics.

Capability, not dependency
Worked across enablers, MCNs, TSPs, agencies, and local teams to build internal operating capability that lasts.

SPEAKING

I speak to leadership teams and operators about what actually breaks at scale:

Why digital commerce strategies fail after the plan looks “right”

Building growth pillars instead of fragile channel wins

Operating SEA multi-market commerce without chaos

CTA: Invite me to speak

ABOUT

I’ve spent the last decade working at the intersection of commerce, performance, and execution across Southeast Asia.
