## Hero

Most e-commerce strategies look right until they break at scale.

I build the systems that don't.

I'm Jocelyn Pang, a digital commerce strategist-operator. I build durable e-commerce growth pillars for FMCG brands across Southeast Asia—not fragile wins that collapse under their own weight.

Trusted by teams in Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.

## How I Help

### From fragile growth to durable pillar

**The Problem: E-commerce is growing, but it's fragile.**

Most FMCG teams treat e-commerce as a performance channel. Hit the ROAS target. Run another campaign. Chase the next platform feature. It works—until market conditions shift, competition intensifies, or the algorithm changes. Then growth stalls, and teams scramble for the next tactic.

**The Intervention: I don't optimize for campaigns. I build for compounding.**

Growth that sticks requires more than good tactics—it requires durable systems. I help leadership teams see the structural gaps in their e-commerce foundations: the channel dependencies, the margin leaks, the capability blind spots. Then I help them fix what matters.

**The Outcome: Your e-commerce becomes a pillar, not a project.**

When the foundations are right, growth compounds. Teams stop firefighting and start building. Digital commerce becomes a predictable, defensible growth engine—one that holds up when conditions change.

## About

I started in distribution. Learned the cost structures and tradeoffs that sit underneath everything else.

Then I spent years in the trenches: growing a portfolio in a category that was actively shrinking. Building channels that didn't exist before. Fixing fundamentals that everyone else ignored.

Now I build commerce engines across six countries.

What I've learned is simple: growth fails when teams chase channels instead of building systems.

## Selected Work

### Building FMCG commerce across Southeast Asia

#### Case Study 1: Plant-based FMCG Brand
**Zero to growth pillar in 6 months**

The brand was entering digital commerce across Southeast Asia. No existing channels. Different platform ecosystems per market. The brief was speed without sacrificing execution quality.

Built and launched digital commerce in Malaysia, Philippines, and Vietnam. Stood up social commerce, affiliate, and content selling capabilities. Aligned local teams and partners.

All three markets now operate as growth pillars. The capabilities transferred to local teams.

#### Case Study 2: Health & Wellness Brand
**From underperformance to category leader**

When I took over, the eContent score was under 10%. Online contribution was flat. Distribution was limited to a handful of channels.

Built 10+ new distribution channels that didn't exist before. Fixed the fundamentals in 3 months. Created a playbook that other regional markets adapted.

+60% category over-indexing in Vitamins & Supplements. Online contribution grew by 8 percentage points.

#### Case Study 3: Infant Nutrition Brand
**Growth in a shrinking market**

Baby formula was declining -2.7% year-on-year. The category had headwinds. Parallel imports were diluting brand presence on key platforms.

Drove new user acquisition at scale. Eliminated parallel imports on key accounts. Negotiated prime campaign visibility during mega sales.

+45% category over-indexing for core brand. Proved digital could offset offline decline.
